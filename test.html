                Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
                I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
                The evil that men do lives after them;
                The good is oft interred with their bones;
                So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
                Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
                If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
                And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
            </p1>
