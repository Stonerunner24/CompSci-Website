                Game Development is a diverse field requiring cooperation between many different professions 
                such as artists, management, and computer scientists. A computer scientist's main role in development 
                is developing the functionality of the game, but they can also play other roles.

                        Gameplay Engineers handle developing all of the functionality of a videogame. 
                        They work primarily in game engines such as Unreal Engine or in-house engines 
                        specially developed for the company.

                        development. They most usually are responsible for integrating the systems a 
                        gameplay engineer has made with the visuals the artists have made.

                        the different systems will work.
