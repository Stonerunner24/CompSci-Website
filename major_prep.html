                No! You do not need Computer Experience to study computer science.
                Many people have gone into university with no knowledge of Copmuter
                science concepts. The great thing about school is that you learn! 
                In computer science courses, you will be taught everything you need
                to know in order to do your work.

                        for help or for resources. And if you do not have time for
                        any of that, watch youtube!

                There is no problem with having a bunch of CS knowledge,
                it will definitely help more than hinder. But those who
                do not have much knowledge are also in a good postion. 
                The driving value of Copmuter Science is curiosity.
                Don't give up, and try your hardest!
