            <p><br><br>Learning CS may well be valuable as a career, but what is it like to study it? 
                Majoring in CS is challenging, with many different and contrasting demands on students' abilities and time, 
                but it is also incredibly rewarding.

                    <p>
                        Depending on the university, academic life can vary 
                        considerably. The coding languages taught in introductory
                        classes, concepts required or left for electives, amounts 
                        of math instruction and more will all change from school 
                        to school. <br>
                        <br>
                        However, most CS programs follow similar lines. Students 
                        will begin learning one or two more accessible languages 
                        while they master the basic concepts of programming. As time 
                        goes on, they will gain the freedom to choose which language 
                        they work in while studying higher concepts like software 
                        engineering, human computer interaction, and AI. <br>
                        <br>
                        CS majors are academically rigorous. Students can often expect to 
                        work on several coding or other CS projects at once during the bulk of the semester, 
                        while also juggling mathematics and general education requirements.

                    <p>
                        College is an incredibly unique social time for all students, 
                        and CS majors are no exception. Young adults living in a community filled 
                        almost exclusively with peers of their own age, little to 
                        no "adult" supervision, and enough freedom to do (mostly) whatever
                        they want creates a social evironment perfect for making friends and 
                        exploring.  <br>
                        <br>
                        CS majors often have a repuation of being shy, awkward, and introverted. 
                        While, like all stereotypes, it sometimes holds true, CS majors can cultivate
                        vibrant social spheres just as easily as anyone else. In fact, it is vitally 
                        important for them to do so! Many CS majors participate in extracirriculars, 
                        either within the department in coding clubs, or outside, in music, Greek life, 
                        student government, and more. <br>
                        <br>
                        School always comes first: education is the primary reason for attending college, 
                        and CS majors often have a large academic load. With care and attention, though, 
                        students can strike a balance between social and academic life.

                        When juggling the often opposing demands of academia and social spheres, it can 
                        be all too easy to let self-care slip through the cracks. This is sometimes 
                        particularly a struggle for CS majors, who habitually stay up late into the night 
                        staring into computer screens as they work on school and personal projects.<br>
                        <br>
                        Personal projects are very important! Fostering a curiosity and love for CS beyond 
                        coursework does a world of good for increasing both skill and enjoyment for students. 
                        Employers, too, will often heavily favor graduates who have projects under their belts 
                        above ones who simply have coursework. <br>
                        <br>
                        However, a major as tiring as CS requires a lot of rest. Keeping healthy eating 
                        and sleeping habits will improve students' ability to think clearly and work well.
